Cursor agent permissions – Voicetree
=====================================

This project is set up so agents can work without getting stuck on permission prompts.

What’s in the repo (version-controlled)
----------------------------------------
- .cursor/rules/agent-permissions.mdc   → Tells the agent it may act without asking.
- .cursor/rules/terminal-and-tools.mdc   → Use terminal and tools freely.
- AGENTS.md                              → Same instructions for any agent reading the repo.

Optional: Cursor UI (one-time)
-----------------------------
To reduce or remove approval prompts in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+, or Ctrl+,).
2. Go to: Cursor Settings → Agents → Auto-Run.
3. Set Auto-Run Mode to one of:
   - "Run in Sandbox" – commands run in a sandbox when possible (recommended).
   - "Run Everything" – no approval prompts (maximum automation, higher risk).

You can also enable:
- Allow Git Writes Without Approval
- Auto-Run Network Access (if the agent needs network in sandbox)

Optional: Workspace settings (local only)
-----------------------------------------
.vscode/ is gitignored. To use workspace-specific Cursor settings on your machine:

1. Create .vscode/settings.json in the repo root if it doesn’t exist.
2. Add Cursor agent settings, e.g.:

   "cursor.terminalSecurityLevel": "off"
   "cursor.terminal.allowList": [ "uv", "uv run", "npm", "pytest", "git status", ... ]

See Cursor docs: Agent → Terminal, Agent → Security.

Summary
-------
- Rules + AGENTS.md: agent is instructed to proceed without asking (committed).
- Cursor Auto-Run + allowlist: fewer or no UI approval dialogs (your choice).
Together they keep agents from getting stuck on permission in this folder.
